# Quote application with blockchain

*A project for blockchain beginners.*

This **Quote Application** is built with **solidity, python and react typescript**.
By using this application one can *upload a quote*, which will be visible to all the users.

The **smart contract** which is built with **solidity** has capabilities of **adding a new user**, **uploading a quote** and **catching new quotes uploaded at that time**.

The python script `deploy_app.py` is the main script to deploy a new contract to a network like `kovan`, `rinkeby`, etc.
To run this script you will need [brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python pakage installed.

The **Web UI** is built with **React Typescript**. One should have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) installed to run this application.

By using **MetaMask** and some **kovan chain faucets**, one can **interact** with the smart contract.

- [@useDApp/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@usedapp/core) is used here to **call the functions** of the **smart contract** deployed on the live chain.

- [@material-ui/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core) is used here to **style** the **Web UI** within the **typescript** file.

- [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) npm package is used here to **show notifications** in the **Web UI**.
